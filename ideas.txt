unity networking idea:

Networking on separate thread

with a thread-safe queue of function pointers to run on the main thread.
Another thread-safe queue in this networking object that holds parameters for these functions.

Need to revamp messaging system.

Instead of using strings, read and write raw bytes. This would eliminate costly conversions, like string to int and string to float.
This might be better for the future.

Create a simple script that can be attached to an object (that needs to be networked) that sends position/necessary information to server

Might be better to implement a simple tick system on the server, rather than just forwarding bytes between server and client. This way things can
be done without overloading the client with data. 

DeadStation ideas:

Shotgun - reduce number of instantiations when fired. Maybe just one instantiation in a non random spawn pattern? or just a couple of animations?
where does the difficulty with this game lie?
	1) Strategic weapon upgrades?
	2) Story finding?
	3) Time based runs?
	4) Item finding? (RNG drops?)
	5) Could be other abilities... based on a player type, like ROR2
	6) Could pick up different abilities, like a skill tree? Could be unlocked with findable items, or by leveling up?
	7) Combination of item abilities, natural player abilities, and unlocked abilities
	8) Build trees?
	9) health management?
	10) Inventory management? (no ammo)
	11) Temporary powerups, like old school arcade shooters?
	
There are also story items that players can pick up and read that might give just cool story info or lockbox combinations

The Story of Holden Maxwell

Story - Let's follow the Hero's Journey

==== ORDINARY WORLD ====
You are apart of the security personnel for a space station, stationed above a planet for the purposes of studying the planet and assessing potential resources that can be
harvested from it before resource excavation ships come in and harvest the resources. Since most of the inhabitants of the station are academics, the job is fairly boring, 
bordering on a useless position. There are 10 of you on the entire ship, including the captain.

After some of the scientists return from the planet after a routine survey (ship instruments can't pick up everything), one of the scientists becomes ill. He is sent to the infirmary where he is deemed fine
and he is sent on his way. Later in the cafeteria, the scientist becomes violently ill, vomits blood, then dies on the spot. After trying to revive him without success, it seems that he is dead. The coworkers are
stunned. He begins to move only minutes later as a medical team shows up. The main person on the medical team is bit by the person. Seconds after he is bit, his eyes roll into the back of his head and he lets out a scream,
as he too vomits blood. Biting left and right ensues, this is the beginning of the outbreak. As would-be heros attempt to stop the biting, they end up getting bit as well. The horde grows quickly as people can't 
leave the cafeteria fast enough, and the infection spreads like wildfire.

==== CALL TO ADVENTURE ====
You awake from your midday nap on the job to blaring alarms and shouting over the radios. The captain is yelling as other officer's screams and gunfire can be heard over the radios.
Now awake in front of the camera monitor, you begin taking a look at the carnage taking place in the space station. You see officer's getting bit from behind as they try to fight off the
undead, some die helping others, some die running away, even the captain gets surrounded before the camera goes dead.

==== REFUSAL OF THE CALL ====
Seeing your fellow officers being maimed and killed in front of you, you decide to make your way to the evacuation pods as quickly as possible.
On the way there, you get a radio transmission from a survivor begging for help. He sees your life signs and recognizes your suit to belong to security. He states that he and a group of people 
need help. You respond that you are the last of the security team left, and they would be better off taking their chances on the way to the evac pods.
"We need your help!"
"Are you serious? These things are crazy! We need to make our way to the evac pods now!"
"We don't have that option - we're barricaded in the gym with those things on the other side of all our doors."
"Shit! Well what do I do then?"
"We need you to come take care of the dead outside so that we can make it to the evac pods - please hurry, they know we're in here and are about to break through our door!" 
As soon as you get there, the doors are open and everyone inside is dead. You fight the dead and kill them off. You silently curse to yourself. You now go to the evac pod room, but there are too many zombies 
and they are too strong to battle with your current weapon. 

==== MEETING THE MENTOR ====
A voice appears in your helmet. 
"Run! Down the hall!"
You meet the medical researcher Dean Wilkes
You run down the hall as zombies begin to gain on you. The final door that you get through slams behind you.
"Who are you?"
"I'm Dr. Brian Wilkes. I'm a medical researcher in this facility working under the lead researcher, Dr. Martin. I need to meet with you in person. We have much to discuss if we plan on escaping this place with our lives.
I am located in our secure clean room in research lab 12 - You'll need to take the elevator up to the offices, go through engineering, and then find my lab."
"Ok Dr. Wilkes. I'm on my way"
"Please, call me Brian. I'll see you soon, Holden. Be safe, watch your back, and whatever you do, do not get bit."

==== CROSSING THE THRESHOLD ====
Your journey now begins. The first subtask of finding Dr. Wilkes is to get to the elevator from where you are now, which is close to the gym and the evacuation pods.
Of course, however, there are plenty of zombies in your way. There are rooms to explore, items to pick up that enhance abilities, items to pick up that you can read (lore).
Introduce grenades?
